//Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.
//
//String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
//
//Find the letter that was added in t.
//
//Example:
//
//Input:
//s = "abcd"
//t = "abcde"
//
//Output:
//e
//
//Explanation:
//'e' is the letter that was added.
